### **Back-to-Back Stem-and-Leaf Display**

**Example Question:**

Two departments at a company recorded the number of sales made by their top 10 salespeople in a month. The number of sales made are as follows:

- **Department X Sales**: 12, 14, 17, 19, 21, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32
- **Department Y Sales**: 13, 16, 18, 20, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33

Construct a back-to-back stem-and-leaf display for the two departments' sales data.

---

**Solution:**

Back-to-Back Stem-and-Leaf Display:

```
Department X (Leaf)   Stem   Department Y (Leaf)
       2 4 7 9         1         3 6 8
       1 4 6 8         2         0 3 5 7 9
           0 2         3         1 3

```

**Key:**

- The **stem** represents the tens place (e.g., 1 = 10s, 2 = 20s, etc.).
- Leaves on the **left** are from **Department X**, while leaves on the **right** are from **Department Y**.
- **Example**: In Department X, "2 4 7 9" corresponds to 12, 14, 17, 19.

---

**Key Tips for Exam:**

- List leaves in **ascending order** for each stem.
- A back-to-back display allows comparison of two data sets side by side.

### **Box Plot Construction**

**Example Question:**

Given the following dataset of students' test scores:

55, 60, 62, 63, 65, 68, 70, 72, 73, 77, 78, 80, 85, 88

Tasks:

1. **Determine the five-number summary (minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum).**
2. **Calculate the interquartile range (IQR) and determine whisker limits using $1.5 \times \text{IQR}.$**
3. **Draw the box plot** 
4. **Identify any potential outliers.**

---

### **Step-by-Step Solution:**

### **Step 1: Five-Number Summary**

The five-number summary consists of the following:

- **Minimum (Min)**: The smallest value in the dataset.
- **First Quartile (Q1)**: The value below which 25% of the data falls.
- **Median (Q2)**: The middle value of the dataset (50th percentile).
- **Third Quartile (Q3)**: The value below which 75% of the data falls.
- **Maximum (Max)**: The largest value in the dataset.

For the given dataset:

$$
\text{Data (sorted)}: 55, 60, 62, 63, 65, 68, 70, 72, 73, 77, 78, 80, 85, 88
$$

- **Minimum**:55
- **Maximum**:88
- **Median (Q2)**: Middle value =  (7th and 8th values averaged). 70
- **First Quartile (Q1)**: Median of the first half = 63
- **Third Quartile (Q3)**: Median of the second half = 78

### **Step 2: Calculate IQR and Whisker Limits**

The interquartile range (IQR) is calculated as follows:

IQR=Q3−Q1

For this dataset:

IQR=78−63=15

**Whisker Limits** are calculated as:

- **Lower Whisker Limit**:

$$
Q1 - (1.5 \times \text{IQR}) = 63 - (1.5 \times 15) = 63 - 22.5 = 40.5
$$

- **Upper Whisker Limit**:

$$
Q3 + (1.5 \times \text{IQR}) = 78 + (1.5 \times 15) = 78 + 22.5 = 100.5
$$

### **Step 3: Identify Outliers**

Outliers are any values that lie outside the whisker limits:

- **Lower Limit**:
    
    40.5
    
- **Upper Limit**:
    
    100.5
    

Since all values in the dataset lie within 40.5≤x≤100.540.5 \leq x \leq 100.5, there are no outliers.


### **Step 4: Plot The Box**
### **Stem-and-Leaf Display**

**Example Question:**

Create a stem-and-leaf display for the following data set:

62, 65, 68, 70, 73, 75, 75, 78, 81, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 92, 95, 96, 98, 100

**Solution Steps:**

1. Group the numbers by tens for the "stem."
2. Write the ones place as the "leaf" next to the corresponding stem.
3. Arrange the leaves in ascending order.

**Stem-and-Leaf Display:**

```
Stem | Leaf
----------------
  6  | 2 5 8
  7  | 0 3 5 5 8
  8  | 1 3 4 5 7 9
  9  | 2 5 6 8
 10  | 0
----------------
Key: 6|2 represents 62
```

Construct a back-to-back stem-and-leaf display for the two departments' sales data.

---

**Solution:**

Back-to-Back Stem-and-Leaf Display:

```
Department X (Leaf)   Stem   Department Y (Leaf)
       2 4 7 9         1         3 6 8
       1 4 6 8         2         0 3 5 7 9
           0 2         3         1 3

```

**Key:**

- The **stem** represents the tens place (e.g., 1 = 10s, 2 = 20s, etc.).
- Leaves on the **left** are from **Department X**, while leaves on the **right** are from **Department Y**.
- **Example**: In Department X, "2 4 7 9" corresponds to 12, 14, 17, 19.

---

**Key Tips for Exam:**

- Always label the two sets of leaves clearly (e.g., Department X and Y).
- List leaves in **ascending order** for each stem.
- A back-to-back display allows comparison of two data sets side by side.

### **Box Plot Construction**

**Example Question:**

Given the following dataset of students' test scores:

55, 60, 62, 63, 65, 68, 70, 72, 73, 77, 78, 80, 85, 88

Tasks:

1. **Determine the five-number summary (minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum).**
2. **Calculate the interquartile range (IQR) and determine whisker limits using $1.5 \times \text{IQR}.$**
3. **Draw the box plot** 
4. **Identify any potential outliers.**

---

### **Step-by-Step Solution:**

### **Step 1: Five-Number Summary**

The five-number summary consists of the following:

- **Minimum (Min)**: The smallest value in the dataset.
- **First Quartile (Q1)**: The value below which 25% of the data falls.
- **Median (Q2)**: The middle value of the dataset (50th percentile).
- **Third Quartile (Q3)**: The value below which 75% of the data falls.
- **Maximum (Max)**: The largest value in the dataset.

For the given dataset:

$$
\text{Data (sorted)}: 55, 60, 62, 63, 65, 68, 70, 72, 73, 77, 78, 80, 85, 88
$$

- **Minimum**:55
- **Maximum**:88
- **Median (Q2)**: Middle value =  (7th and 8th values averaged). 70
- **First Quartile (Q1)**: Median of the first half = 63
- **Third Quartile (Q3)**: Median of the second half = 78

### **Step 2: Calculate IQR and Whisker Limits**

The interquartile range (IQR) is calculated as follows:

IQR=Q3−Q1

For this dataset:

IQR=78−63=15

**Whisker Limits** are calculated as:

- **Lower Whisker Limit**:

$$
Q1 - (1.5 \times \text{IQR}) = 63 - (1.5 \times 15) = 63 - 22.5 = 40.5
$$

- **Upper Whisker Limit**:

$$
Q3 + (1.5 \times \text{IQR}) = 78 + (1.5 \times 15) = 78 + 22.5 = 100.5
$$

### **Step 3: Identify Outliers**

Outliers are any values that lie outside the whisker limits:

- **Lower Limit**:
    
    40.5
    
- **Upper Limit**:
    
    100.5
    

Since all values in the dataset lie within $40.5 \leq x \leq 100.5$, there are no outliers.

**Five-Number Summary for Group B**: [5, 7, 10, 15, 18]

---

## b. Draw Box Plots for Both Groups

### Step 1: Calculate the IQR and Whisker Limits

#### Group A:
- **IQR** = Q3 - Q1 = 15 - 9 = 6  
- **Lower Limit** = Q1 - (1.5 \* IQR) = 9 - (1.5 \* 6) = 0  
- **Upper Limit** = Q3 + (1.5 \* IQR) = 15 + (1.5 \* 6) = 24  

#### Group B:
- **IQR** = Q3 - Q1 = 15 - 7 = 8  
- **Lower Limit** = Q1 - (1.5 \* IQR) = 7 - (1.5 \* 8) = -5  
- **Upper Limit** = Q3 + (1.5 \* IQR) = 15 + (1.5 \* 8) = 27  

### Step 2: Identify Outliers
- **Group A**: No values below 0 or above 24 → **No outliers**  
- **Group B**: No values below -5 or above 27 → **No outliers**  

### Draw Box Plots:

![alt text](<Box Plot 2.png>)

## c. Compare the Two Groups


- **Group A** has a higher median (13) compared to **Group B** (10).

- **Group A** has a smaller IQR (6), meaning its values are more tightly clustered.
- **Group B** has a larger IQR (8), indicating greater variability in its data.

- Neither group has any outliers.


- Group A has a **higher median** and is more consistent (smaller IQR).
- Group B has a **larger spread** with more diverse data points.
- Neither group contains outliers.

### Calculate the Trimean for a dataset below  
**Data set**:  
10, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 50  

**Solution**:  
**Step 1**: Sort the Data  
The data is already sorted in ascending order:  
10, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 50  

**Step 2**: Find the Median  
Since there are 15 values (an odd number), the median is the 8th value in the sorted list:  
$$
\text{Median} = 30
$$

**Step 3**: Find Q1 and Q3  
- **Q1 (1st Quartile)**: This is the median of the lower half of the data (excluding the median itself):  
  $$ 
  Q1 = \text{Median}(10, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27) = 18
  $$

- **Q3 (3rd Quartile)**: This is the median of the upper half of the data (excluding the median itself):  
  $$ 
  Q3 = \text{Median}(33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 50) = 42
  $$

**Step 4**: Calculate the Trimean  
The formula for the trimean is:  
$$
\text{Trimean} = \frac{Q1 + 2 \times \text{Median} + Q3}{4}
$$  
Substitute the values:  
$$
\text{Trimean} = \frac{18 + 2 \times 30 + 42}{4} = \frac{120}{4} = 30
$$


### Geometric Mean  
Suppose the population of a city changes over four years with the following annual growth rates:  
Year 1: +5%  
Year 2: +10%  
Year 3: −3%  
Year 4: +6%  

Calculate the geometric mean of the growth rates to find the average population growth rate over these 4 years.  

**Solution**:  
**Step 1**: Convert percentages to growth factors  
Convert each percentage into a decimal growth factor by adding 1:  
- Year 1: 1 + 0.05 = 1.05  
- Year 2: 1 + 0.10 = 1.10  
- Year 3: 1 − 0.03 = 0.97  
- Year 4: 1 + 0.06 = 1.06  

**Step 2**: Calculate the product of the growth factors  
$$
1.05 \times 1.10 \times 0.97 \times 1.06 = 1.187571
$$

**Step 3**: Calculate the geometric mean  
Since there are 4 years, the geometric mean is the 4th root of the product:  
$$
\text{Geometric Mean} = \sqrt[4]{1.187571} \approx 1.043914418
$$

**Step 4**: Convert back to percentage  
To express this as a percentage growth rate, subtract 1 and multiply by 100:  
$$
1.043914418 - 1 = 0.04391441816 \times 100 = 4.39\%
$$

**Conclusion**  
The average annual population growth rate over these 4 years is approximately 4.26% per year, even though the individual rates varied each year. The geometric mean smooths out the effect of the fluctuations and gives a meaningful long-term average growth rate.

### Trimmed Mean  
Consider the following dataset of 10 values representing exam scores:  
65, 70, 72, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 95, 100  

Calculate the 10% trimmed mean.  

**Solution**:  
**Step 1**: Sort the data (if not already sorted)  
In this case, the data is already sorted in ascending order:  
65, 70, 72, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 95, 100  

**Step 2**: Trim 10% from both ends  
Since we have 10 values, trimming 10% means removing 10% of the values from each end.  
10% of 10 = 1 value from the top and 1 value from the bottom.  
So, remove the smallest value (65) and the largest value (100).  

**Step 3**: Calculate the mean of the remaining values  
The remaining values are:  
70, 72, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 95  
Now, calculate the mean of these 8 values:  
$$
\text{Sum} = 70 + 72 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 92 + 95 = 659
$$

**Conclusion**  
The 10% trimmed mean of the dataset is 82.375.  
By trimming the lowest and highest values (65 and 100), we remove the possible influence of any outliers, providing a more robust average value.
# Permutation Combination

## 1. Arranging 4 out of 8 people in a row:

**Problem**:  
You have 8 people, and you need to select and arrange 4 of them in a row for a photo. How many different ways can you arrange them?

**Solution**:  
Here, $n = 8$ (total people) and $r = 4$ (people to arrange).  
We use the permutation formula:  
$$P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}$$

**Step 1**:  
Calculate $8!$ and $4!$:  
$$8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 40,320$$  
$$4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24$$

**Step 2**:  
Now, calculate $P(8, 4)$:  
$$P(8, 4) = \frac{8!}{(8 - 4)!} = \frac{40,320}{24} = 1,680$$

Thus, there are **1,680** ways to arrange 4 people out of 8 in a row.

## 2. Selecting 4 books from 7:

**Problem**:  
You have 7 books, and you want to choose 4 to take on a trip. How many different ways can you select the books?

**Solution**:  
This is a combination problem where $n = 7$ and $r = 4$.  
The combination formula is:  
$$C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}$$

**Step 1**:  
Substitute $n = 7$ and $r = 4$:  
$$C(7, 4) = \frac{7!}{4!(7 - 4)!}$$  
$$C(7, 4) = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 35$$

So, there are **35** ways to choose 4 books from a set of 7.

## 3. Probability of drawing exactly 3 red balls out of 5 selected from a bag of 10 red and 15 blue balls:

**Problem**:  
A bag contains 10 red balls and 15 blue balls. If you randomly select 5 balls without replacement, what is the probability that exactly 3 of the selected balls are red?

**Solution**:  
Given:  
- $N = 25$ (total balls)  
- $k = 10$ (total red balls)  
- $n = 5$ (balls selected)  
- $x = 3$ (we want to find the probability of selecting 3 red balls)  

Using the hypergeometric formula:  
$$p = \frac{{kCx \times (N-k)C(n-x)}}{NCn}$$

**Step 1**:  
Calculate combinations:  
For context we have to multiply those combinations of red and blue to achieve the number of possible combinations of those red and blue balls and we divide it with the total number of combinations to actually achive the percentage result
$$10C3 = \frac{10!}{7! \times 3!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 120$$  
$$15C2 = \frac{15!}{13! \times 2!} = \frac{15 \times 14}{2 \times 1} = 105$$

**Step 2**:  
Now, calculate the total combinations:  
$$25C5 = \frac{25!}{20! \times 5!} = \frac{25 \times 24 \times 23 \times 22 \times 21}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 53,130$$

**Step 3**:  
Now calculate the probability:  
$$p = \frac{120 \times 105}{53,130} = \frac{12,600}{53,130} \approx 0.2372$$

Thus, the probability of drawing exactly 3 red balls is approximately **0.2372** or **23.72%**.

## 1. Probability of getting exactly 3 heads when flipping a fair coin 5 times

**Solution**:  
Given:
- $ N = 5 $ (number of trials)  
- $ x = 3 $ (number of successes)  
- $ \pi = 0.5 $ (probability of success, i.e., getting heads)

Using the formula:  
$$P(x = 3) = 5C3 \times \pi^x \times (1 - \pi)^{N - x}$$

**Calculation**:  
$$P(x = 3) = 5C3\times 0.5^3 \times (1 - 0.5)^{5 - 3}$$ 
$$P(x = 3) = \frac{5!}{3! \times 2!} \times 0.5^3 \times (1 - 0.5)^{5 - 3}$$  
$$P(x = 3) = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} \times 0.5^3 = \frac{10}{2} \times \frac{1}{32} = 5 \times \frac{1}{32} = \frac{5}{16}$$

Thus, the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 flips of a fair coin is **$\frac{5}{16}$** or approximately **0.3125**.

## 2. Probability of making *at least 12* successful free throws

**Solution**:  
To find the probability of making at least 12 successful free throws, we need to calculate  
$$P(x \geq 12) = P(x = 12) + P(x = 13) + P(x = 14) + P(x = 15)$$  

**Calculation for \(P(x = 12)\)**:  
Given:
- $ N = 15 $ 
- $ \pi = 0.8   $

$$P(x = 12) = \frac{15!}{12! \times 3!} \times 0.8^{12} \times (1 - 0.8)^3$$  
$$P(x = 12) = \frac{15 \times 14 \times 13}{3 \times 2 \times 1} \times 0.8^{12} \times 0.2^3 \approx 0.250138895319$$  

**Calculation for \(P(x = 13)\)**:  
$$P(x = 13) = \frac{15!}{13! \times 2!} \times 0.8^{13} \times 0.2^2 \approx 0.230897441833$$  

**Calculation for \(P(x = 14)\)**:  
$$P(x = 14) = \frac{15!}{14! \times 1!} \times 0.8^{14} \times 0.2^1 \approx 0.131941395333$$  

**Calculation for \(P(x = 15)\)**:  
$$P(x = 15) = 0.8^{15} \approx 0.0351843720888$$  

**Summing all probabilities**:  
$$P(x \geq 12) = 0.250138895319 + 0.131941395333 + 0.230897441833 + 0.0351843720888 = 0.648162104574$$

Thus, the probability that the player makes at least 12 successful free throws is approximately **0.648**.

## 3. Pearson Correlation Coefficient

**Solution**:  
Given data for hours of sunlight and corresponding heights of 5 plants:

| Hours of Sunlight (X) | Height (cm) (Y) | xy | x² | y² |
|---------------------|----------------|----|----|----|
| 2                   | 10             |  20 | 4 | 100|
| 4                   | 15             |  60 | 16  | 225 |
| 6                   | 20             | 120  | 36  | 400  |
| 8                   | 25             |  200 | 64  | 625 |
| 10                  | 30             | 300 | 100 | 900|

| $\sum x$| $\sum y$ | $\sum xy$ | $\sum x²$ |$\sum y²$ |
|---------------------|----------------|----|----|----|
| 30                   | 100             |  700 | 220 | 2250|


**Step 2**:  
Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient:  
$$r = \frac{n\sum xy-\sum x\sum y}{\sqrt{[n\sum x^2-(\sum x)^2] \times [n\sum y^2-(\sum )^2] }}$$  
$$r = \frac{5\left(700\right)-3000}{\sqrt{\left(\left(5\cdot220\right)-\left(30\right)^{2}\right)\left(\left(5\cdot2250\right)-\left(100\right)^{2}\right)}} = 1$$

Thus, the Pearson correlation coefficient is **1**.
